@title Master and Workers Simulation

@doc

This is a sample erlang application to simulate masters and worker processes
that finish their task in a random amount of time.

The project has no particular purpose, other than learning. In the source,
there are some sample snippets on how to use edoc, type and spec declarations,
as well as general erlang code with process monitors and links.
